         Hello, my name is Rowan Cameron and I'm 18 years old.  I am from Scotland and have lived here my entire life.  I went to Westhill Academy and in 5th and 6th year took the highers shown above.  This gave me the oppertunity to study Cyber Security at RGU, futher expanding my knowledge in Computing Science and specialising into security. <br><br>
         As well as going to Uni I also am a Snowboard Coach for Aberdeen Snowsports Club.  I am one of the all mountain coaches meaning I get to take people all over the mountain and ride a wide range of terrian.  I also compete in GBX and am on the National Academy.  From this I get to snowboard all over Europe and take part in many different competitions.<br><br>
         I have a bit of experience with computing in the real world also.  I did some work experience at Studio NEC, which taught me alot about how websites are made in a business enviroment and how they go about designing them.  I have also had work experience at Aline Audio Visual.  This is a events company which sets up events and technology for companys and private customers. <br><br>
